# Day 11 – Modules & Libraries

## What I Learned Today
- What Python modules are
- How to import and use built-in modules
- How different modules solve specific problems
- Why modules save time and reduce errors

## Key Concepts
- Modules are pre-written Python files
- import module_name imports the whole module
- from module import item imports specific parts
- os works with files and folders
- sys interacts with the Python system
- datetime handles dates and time
- re searches and matches text patterns
- math provides math operations
- json converts data to and from JSON
- csv reads and writes table-like files
- shutil copies and moves files
- subprocess runs system commands
- logging records program messages safely

## Why This Matters
- Avoids rewriting common code
- Makes programs cleaner
- Enables automation
- Used heavily in real-world projects
