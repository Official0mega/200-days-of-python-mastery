# 🚀 200 Days of Python Mastery

Welcome to **200 Days of Python Mastery** — a public, disciplined, and long-term Python learning challenge designed to build **real, undeniable mastery** through daily practice and consistency.

This repository documents my commitment to **code every single day for 200 consecutive days**, covering Python from **absolute beginner foundations to advanced and expert-level concepts**.

This is not a tutorial dump.  
This is not rushed learning.  
This is **structured, intentional, and accountable growth**.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

By the end of this 200-day challenge, I aim to:

- ✅ Code **every day without skipping**
- ✅ Maintain **daily public GitHub commits**
- ✅ Build **deep understanding** of Python fundamentals
- ✅ Progress confidently into **advanced and professional Python**
- ✅ Write **clean, readable, well-documented code**
- ✅ Develop habits of **discipline, focus, and consistency**
- ✅ Create a learning resource others can follow or fork

Consistency > Motivation.  
Systems > Talent.

## 🧠 What This Repository Covers

This challenge follows a carefully structured curriculum that includes:

- Python basics and syntax
- Data types, variables, and operators
- Control flow (conditions and loops)
- Functions and modular code
- Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- File handling and exception handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Advanced Python features
- Real-world libraries and tools
- Best practices and Pythonic coding style
- Interview-level concepts and explanations

The difficulty increases gradually to ensure **strong foundations before complexity**.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each day has its own dedicated folder:

```
Day_001/
 ├── notes.md   # Clear explanations and learning notes
 └── code.py    # Python code written and practiced that day
```

This structure makes it easy to:
- Track daily progress
- Revisit any topic later
- Follow the challenge sequentially
- Fork the repo and start your own challenge

---

## 🗓️ Daily Progress & Accountability

All daily activity is tracked in:

📄 **DAILY_LOG.md**

Each day includes:
- Date
- Topic studied
- What I learned
- What I built
- Time spent
- Difficulty rating

This ensures **full transparency and accountability** throughout the challenge.
