# Day 10 – Context Managers

## What I Learned Today
- What context managers are
- Why the with statement is used
- How with handles setup and cleanup
- How to create custom context managers
- How __enter__ and __exit__ work
- How errors are handled inside context managers

## Key Concepts
- Context managers manage resources safely
- with automatically handles setup and cleanup
- Files close automatically when using with
- __enter__() runs at the start of with
- __exit__() runs at the end of with
- Returning True in __exit__ stops errors from crashing the program

## Why This Matters
- Prevents resource leaks
- Makes code safer
- Handles errors cleanly
- Removes need for manual cleanup
