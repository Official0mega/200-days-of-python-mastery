# Day 7 – Class Relationships

## What I Learned Today
- How classes relate to each other
- Difference between Composition and Aggregation
- How static methods and class methods work
- How @property protects and controls data

## Key Concepts
- Composition = strong ownership (HAS-A)
- Aggregation = loose connection (USES-A)
- Static methods do not use self or class data
- Class methods work with class-level data using cls
- @property lets methods behave like variables
- Property setters protect data from bad values

## Why This Matters
- Builds real-world program structures
- Improves code organization and safety
- Prevents wrong data usage
- Makes code easier to maintain
