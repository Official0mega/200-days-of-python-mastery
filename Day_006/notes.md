# Day 6 – Magic (Dunder) Methods

## What I Learned Today
- What magic (dunder) methods are
- How __str__ and __repr__ control object printing
- How __len__, __getitem__, __setitem__ work
- How objects are compared and added using magic methods
- What operator overloading means

## Key Concepts
- Magic methods start and end with __
- They run automatically
- __str__ → user-friendly output
- __repr__ → developer-friendly output
- __len__ → length of object
- __getitem__ / __setitem__ → index access
- __eq__, __lt__, __add__ → comparisons and addition
- Operator overloading gives new meaning to operators

## Why This Matters
- Makes objects behave like built-in types
- Improves readability and usability
- Enables custom object behavior
