# Day 5 – Core OOP Concepts

## What I Learned Today
- Encapsulation for protecting class data
- Inheritance for reusing code
- Polymorphism for same action, different behavior
- Abstraction for defining rules without implementation

## Key Concepts
- Encapsulation hides data using public, protected, and private attributes
- Inheritance allows child classes to reuse parent class code
- Polymorphism lets methods behave differently in different classes
- Method overriding replaces parent behavior in child classes
- Method overloading is simulated using default values
- Abstraction uses abstract base classes to enforce structure

## Why This Matters
- Protects important data
- Reduces code repetition
- Makes programs flexible and scalable
- Enforces clean program design
