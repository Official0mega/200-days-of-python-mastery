# Day 2 – File Handling (CSV, JSON, Safe Operations)

## What I Learned Today
- How to read and write **CSV files**
- How to read and write **JSON files**
- Why and how to use `with open()` safely
- How to handle file errors using `try / except`

## Key Concepts
- CSV = table-like text data
- JSON = dictionary-like data
- `with open()` auto-closes files
- Exceptions prevent program crashes

## Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to close files
- Using wrong file mode (`r`, `w`, `a`)
- Writing non-string data directly
- File not found errors

## Mini Project
- Read names from a text file
- Save names into CSV
- Save summary into JSON
