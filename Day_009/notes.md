# Day 9 – Decorators

## What I Learned Today
- What decorators are
- How function decorators work
- How to chain multiple decorators
- How class decorators modify classes

## Key Concepts
- A decorator adds extra behavior without changing original code
- Function decorators wrap functions
- Decorators return a new function or class
- @decorator is shorthand for function = decorator(function)
- Chained decorators run top to bottom but execute inside-out
- Class decorators receive and return a class

## Why This Matters
- Keeps code clean
- Reuses functionality
- Adds behavior without rewriting code
