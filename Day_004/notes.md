# Day 4 – Introduction to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

## What I Learned Today
- What Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is
- Difference between Classes and Objects
- How __init__() works
- Instance variables vs Class variables
- Methods and the use of self

## Key Concepts
- OOP models code like real life
- Class = blueprint
- Object = real instance of a class
- __init__() runs when an object is created
- Instance variables belong to one object
- Class variables are shared by all objects
- Methods define what an object can do
- self refers to the current object

## Why OOP is Useful
- Organizes code
- Reuses logic
- Makes large programs easier to manage
