# Day 3 – Error and Exception Handling

## What I Learned Today
- How Python handles errors without crashing
- How to use try, except, else, and finally
- How to raise errors manually using raise
- How to create and use custom exceptions

## Key Concepts
- Errors stop a program if not handled
- try → risky code
- except → handles errors
- else → runs if no error happens
- finally → always runs
- raise → manually trigger an error
- Custom exceptions make errors clearer

## Why This Matters
- Prevents program crashes
- Shows friendly error messages
- Makes programs safer and cleaner
